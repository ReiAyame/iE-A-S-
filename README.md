# iEnroll

iEnroll is a simple online enrollment web application to give user an idea or view on how a web app will make the school manage its students' information easier. This application contains more on add, update and delete functions; without those complicated stuffs.

This was submitted as my team's final project for Web Application course in Saint Louis University, Baguio City.
